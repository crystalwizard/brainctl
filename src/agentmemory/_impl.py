    Implements the temporal-difference Q-learning update rule from MemRL
    (Zhang et al. 2026). reward=1.0 on positive contribution, 0.0 otherwise.
    Q-value is clamped to [0, 1] after each update.

    Bug 9 fix (2.2.0): collapsed prior SELECT-then-UPDATE into a single
    atomic UPDATE that performs the TD step inline using SQLite arithmetic.
    The old read-modify-write was racy under concurrent agents — two writers
    could both read q_old before either wrote q_new, losing one update. The
    new form is a single statement and atomic at the SQLite page level.
    Retired memories are still skipped via the WHERE clause.

    Args:
        db: Active sqlite3 connection. Caller owns the transaction lifecycle.
        memory_id: Integer PK of the memory being updated.
        contributed: True if the memory contributed to a useful outcome.
        learning_rate: TD step size alpha (default _Q_LEARNING_RATE = 0.1).

    Side effects:
        Issues an UPDATE on memories. **Does NOT commit** — the caller is
        responsible for committing once per request, after processing all
        results in the batch.

    perf/latency-baseline (2.3.x): removed a per-call ``db.commit()`` here.
    Both production callers — ``_retrieval_practice_boost`` (which is itself
    called per-result by ``cmd_search``) and ``cmd_memory_search`` — already
    commit at the end of the search request, so the per-row commit was
    issuing 5 extra fsyncs per cmd_search call (one per result × ~5 results).
    cProfile @ N=1k showed ``commit`` ~100ms / 50 cmd_search calls
    (~2ms/call); removing it cut cmd_search p95 from 35.2 → 22.6 ms (-36%).
    The atomic update statement is unchanged, so the docstring's race-safety
    contract still holds; only the implicit transaction boundary moved out
    by one frame.

    **Durability tradeoff (intentional):** before this change, the q_value
    increment was durable on function return. Now it is durable only after
    the caller's end-of-request commit. If the process is killed (SIGTERM,
    OOM) between this UPDATE and the caller's commit, the q_value
    increment is lost. q_values are heuristic ranking weights, not
    correctness-critical state — losing a single TD step has no
    user-visible effect. If this trade ever needs to be reversed (e.g. for
    a higher-stakes use of the q_value field), restore the explicit
    ``db.commit()`` and accept the -30% latency hit. Race-safety (Bug 9)
    is unaffected because the atomic UPDATE is still atomic; this only
    changes when the implicit fsync happens.

    Returns (surprise: float, method: str) where surprise ∈ [0, 1].

    Order of preference:
      1. Cosine similarity against vec_memories (if blob and vec backend available)
      2. FTS5 word-overlap against memories_fts
      3. Vec fallback if FTS5 returns no matches AND blob is available
      4. 0.5 neutral when neither method can compute (cannot infer novelty)

    Bug fix (2.2.3): the previous implementation returned 1.0 when a fallback
    method produced no signal (`fts5_no_matches`, `cosine_no_neighbors`). That
    inflated W(m) novelty so near-duplicates with different vocabulary cleared
    the worthiness gate as "novel" and bloated storage. We now return 0.5 in
    those branches — neutral, neither novel nor redundant — so W(m) decides on
    other signals (recency, source trust, semantic dedup at higher layers).
    The brief recommended embedding the candidate as a vec fallback when FTS5
    finds nothing; we do that ONLY when a blob was already passed in (vec is
    "free" — no extra Ollama round-trip). When no blob is available, embedding
    on the hot write path (called on every memory_add) would add ~100ms per
    write, so we conservatively fall through to 0.5 neutral. The method tag
    embeds the observed signal (e.g. `vec_fallback_max_sim_0.78`) so the next
    debugger can see what actually fired.

    """Re-embed all active memories under a different embedding model.

    Use case: the user is switching ``BRAINCTL_EMBED_MODEL`` (or following
    a default-model bump in a brainctl release) and needs to migrate the
    on-disk ``vec_memories`` virtual table to the new dim. Dim-mismatch
    crashes are otherwise hard to recover from once the new model has
    overwritten one or two rows.

    Flow:

    1. Resolve target model from ``--model`` (defaults to the current
       :data:`EMBED_MODEL`). Look up its dim from the embeddings registry
       so a typo'd model name fails fast.
    2. Compare the target dim to the existing vec_memories DDL via
       :func:`get_db_embedding_dim`. If they match and the user didn't
       pass ``--force``, exit early — nothing to do.
    3. Pull all active memory IDs (``retired_at IS NULL``) ordered by id.
    4. In ``--dry-run`` mode, just print the plan + estimate. Otherwise
       drop and recreate ``vec_memories`` at the new dim, then re-embed
       in batches of ``--batch-size`` (default 64), reporting progress
       every 200 memories.
    5. Warm Ollama once before the loop so the per-batch latency is the
       *steady-state* cost, not the cold-start cost.

    The DDL drop+recreate is destructive — we wrap it in ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``
    so an interrupted reindex leaves a recoverable WAL tail rather than a
    half-truncated vec table. If the embed loop crashes mid-run, the user
    can re-run the command and it'll pick up from "what's missing in
    vec_memories" — see the missing-rows query below.

    """Upgrade the installed brainctl package, then run pending migrations.

    Why this command at all: a brainctl release usually ships both code
    AND new schema migrations, and users were forgetting the second
    half. `brainctl update` makes it one step.

    Flow:
      1. detect install mode (dev / pipx / pip / unknown)
      2. record old version (so we can show a transition in the summary)
      3. run pip/pipx upgrade (or skip for dev installs — git pull is theirs)
      4. read new version from the freshly-installed binary
      5. ask `brainctl doctor --json` whether migrations are safe to run
         (specifically: refuse if migrations.state == "virgin-tracker-with-drift")
      6. shell out to the *new* `brainctl migrate` so it picks up
         schema logic that the parent process can't see (parent has the
         pre-upgrade modules in sys.modules already)
      7. emit a summary

    Why subprocess for the migrate step instead of importing migrate.run:
    after `pip install -U brainctl`, the new code is on disk but the
    parent's `sys.modules` still holds the OLD module objects. A
    sys.modules pop + reimport dance is fragile (transitive imports,
    cached classes); a child process is the clean reset.
