"""Issue #97-7: ``memory_search(multi_pass=True)`` enrichment was too
broad — it added every >4-char word from the top-3 pass-1 results to a
combined OR query and accepted any pass-2 hit, regardless of whether
the hit shared any original-query token. Result: memories connected
only by surface-level word overlap (the user's example: a brainctl/FTS
query pulling in a Pigendom book-analysis memory) showed up as pass-2
hits.

The tightened version drops pass-2 hits that share zero original-query
tokens. This test pins the new behavior.
